Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Computational Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at UC Berkeley, supervised by Prof. Philip Marcus. Currently, I am working on understanding the three-dimensional structure and the remarkable longevity of Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS), which has persisted for at least 166 years. You can read more about me [here](/about)
