Welcome to my website! I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Convection & Climate group at the University of Chicago. My research focuses on the fluid dynamics of climate systems on Earth and other planets. Currently, I am investigating the dynamics of atmospheric rivers using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and a two-layer shallow water model. You can read more about me [here](/about)
