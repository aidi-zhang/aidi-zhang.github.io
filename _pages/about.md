Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Computational Fluid Dynamic Labortory of UC Berkeley, supervised by Prof. Philip Marcus. I gained my B.Eng. degree from Sun Yat-Sen University, majoring in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.

I have tried different research topics when I was an undergraduate. I studied optimization in structural damage detection and Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection simulation. The second experience raised my interest in computational fluid dynamics.

My current research interest now is geophysical and astrophysical fluid dynamics. I am studying the three-dimensional structure and the longevity of the Great Red Spot on Jupiter using the spectral method. I am curious on why the Great Red Spot can survive for such a long time. I am also trying to recover some observation results in our CFD simulations.

I enjoy hiking and photography in my leisure time. I especially like taking photos of interesting astronomy phenomena. I enjoy seeing the most astonishing phenomena in the sky. Here are two photos I took before. One is the Venus transit on Jun 6th, 2012, taken in Guangzhou, China. The other is the total solar eclipse on Aug. 17th, 2017, taken in Madras, Oregon. One of my life goals is to see Venus transit one more time, which will be in 2117 ðŸ™‚
