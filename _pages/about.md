Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Computational Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at UC Berkeley, supervised of Prof. Philip Marcus. My academic journey began at Sun Yat-Sen University, where I earned a B.Eng. degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. Currently, I am working with Prof. Marcus on understanding the three-dimensional structure and the remarkable longevity of Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS), which has persisted for at least 166 years.

Throughout my undergraduate journey, I had the chance to delve into a range of research subjects. I delved into optimizing methods for detecting structural damage and also immersed myself in the realm of simulating two-dimensional Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection. This latter experience notably sparked my interest in computational fluid dynamics. Parallel to my academic pursuits, I've enjoyed stargazing as a hobby since my middle school days. Fortunately, my path led me to the CFD lab at UC Berkeley, where my two passions seamlessly merge into research projects that perfectly align with my interests.

My current research interest focus revolves around the application of fluid dynamics techniques to unravel the underlying physics in geophysical and astrophysical challenges. Consider the Great Red Spot (GRS) on Jupiter â€“ a persistent anticyclone within its atmosphere. To address this, I've developed a home-grown pseudo-spectral method code tailored for navigating the complexities of Jupiter's atmosphere. This encompasses its notable compressibility (referred to as anelastic flow in fluid terminology) and encompasses phenomena that span a broad range of timescales. For example, the buoyancy timescale clocks in at around 10 minutes, the Coriolis timescale at roughly 10 hours, and the vortex turnaround timescale at about 5 days. What truly excites me is the prospect of applying these fluid dynamic techniques to other problems and unlocking the underlying physics behind them.

When I'm not immersed in academic research, I love to go hiking and indulge in photography. My camera often points towards the sky, capturing some pretty cool astronomy stuff. There's something magical about those celestial moments. Let me share a couple of photos with you. First up, we have the Venus transit on June 6th, 2012, snapped in Guangzhou, China. The second shot is from the total solar eclipse on August 17th, 2017, taken in Madras, Oregon. Those were definitely some amazing sights. I've set my sights on catching another Venus transit, which is conveniently scheduled for the year 2117. So, you know, as long as I find the secret to living for another century, I'll be there with my camera! ðŸ˜‰
